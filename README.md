* We shall draw insights about shooting (location,date, time) and the shooter/victim (age, gender, race).
We shall narrow down on the location with the most incidences and draw insights.
Expect some investigative questions about our data set.

> Narrowing down on areas with the most incidences is essential because if law enforcers and policy makers are able to find ways of curtailing incidences in these areas, then some of those strategies can be used to either bring down or avoid incidences in other areas.
>> It is for this reason that the analysis will narrow down to places with most occurences.

* Crime statistics and analysis are important because of various reasons.
> They help criminal justice systems when it comes to predictive policing.
> In age of community policing such statistics help improve relationship with the community.
> They are helpful when it comes to law initiatives with an aim to decrease crime.
