# New-York-City-Shooting-Incidences-EDA

# Introduction

- In the United States, hate crimes and shooting incidents have increased, leading to a national debate on gun control laws. To develop effective police enforcement and intervention strategies, it is essential to gain a thorough understanding of criminal activity through statistical analysis, summary, and insights derived from data sources such as the New York City Shooting Incidences dataset.

- This trend indicates that there is a rise in violence on the streets, making them less safe and in need of an urgent solution.

- We shall draw insights from shooting (location,date, time) and the shooter/victim (age, gender, race).
- We shall narrow down on the location with the most incidences and draw insights.
- Expect some investigative questions about our data set.

  > Focusing on regions with the highest occurrences is crucial because implementing measures to reduce these occurrences in these areas can inform strategies to lower or prevent incidents in other areas, thereby benefiting law enforcement and policymakers.

  > The analysis will focus on locations that have the highest frequency of incidents, hence the reason for the narrowing down.

- Examining areas with fewer incidents could be just as crucial because there may be measures implemented to maintain low figures.
- There are numerous reasons why the analysis and statistics of criminal activity hold significance.

- Their assistance extends to the realm of "predictive policing" within criminal justice systems.
- Amidst the era of community policing, such data assists in enhancing connections with the community.
- When it comes to reducing criminal activity, they offer significant support in the form of legal initiatives.
